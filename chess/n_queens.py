# N-Queens Puzzle!
# 
# The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle that involves placing N queens on 
# an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. 
# In other words, no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal. 
# The goal is to find all possible arrangements of N queens that satisfy these constraints.
# 
# Statement: Construct an n x n matrix with entries of either 0 or 1, ensuring that 
# each row and column contains exactly one 1, and no two 1s are on the same diagonal.
